## Scenarios and Challenges

### Handling Multiple Data Sources
Current Challenge:
The PoC processes a single JSON payload format, but in real-world scenarios, booking data comes from diverse sources like: APIs from travel vendors.
Files in different formats (CSV, XML, JSON).
Webhooks and real-time streams.

Proposed Solution:Implement a message queue (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) to handle real-time ingestion, ensuring data is not lost during high-traffic periods.

### Scaling for Higher Volumes of Data
Current Challenge:
The PoC stores data in a single database without considering scalability for higher traffic or large datasets.

Proposed Solution:
Caching:
Implement a caching layer (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data like bookings for the last 24 hours.
Batch Processing:
Use batch jobs for large data imports with tools like Apache Spark or AWS Batch.

### Error Handling and Retry Mechanisms
Current Challenge:
The PoC lacks robust error-handling mechanisms for scenarios like invalid data, downstream failures, or database connectivity issues.

Proposed Solution:
Data Validation:
Implement schema validation using libraries like ajv for JSON schema validation.
Log validation errors with tools like Elasticsearch or Datadog for analysis.
Retry Policies:
Implement retry logic for transient errors (e.g., network timeouts) using libraries like retry in Node.js.
Use a dead-letter queue to handle persistent failures, allowing for manual or automated retries later.
Transaction Management:
Use database transactions to ensure atomic operations for critical tasks like data insertion.

### Data Security and Compliance
Current Challenge:
The PoC lacks mechanisms for ensuring data security and compliance with regulations like GDPR and PCI-DSS.

Proposed Solution:
Secure Data Transmission:
Use HTTPS for API communication.
Encrypt sensitive data fields (e.g., customer names, booking details) at rest using tools like AWS KMS or Node.js crypto module.
Access Control:
Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to certain APIs or data.
Audit Logging:
Maintain detailed logs of all API requests and modifications for auditing purposes.

### Advanced Features
Real-time Monitoring and Alerts:
Integrate monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana to track system health and performance.
Set up alerts for issues like high response times, failed API requests, or database latency.
Analytics and Reporting:
Build an analytics pipeline to provide insights into booking trends and vendor performance using tools like Apache Flink or AWS Glue.
Vendor-Specific Features:
Develop custom logic for vendor-specific data nuances, such as field mappings or validation rules.

### Development and Deployment
Phased Rollout:
Start with key features and extend functionality iteratively based on business needs.
CI/CD Pipeline:
Automate testing and deployment using tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or CircleCI.

Containerization:
Use Docker and Kubernetes for consistent deployment across environments and seamless scaling.
